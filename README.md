# Incremental Dead State Detection in Logarithmic Time

Welcome! This repository contains the artifact for the paper *Incremental Dead State Detection in Logarithmic Time,* to appear at CAV 2023.
See `cav23.pdf` for the version of the paper at submission time.
The artifact can also be viewed online [here](https://github.com/cdstanford/gid).

## Overview

The artifact provides a data structure, called guided incremental digraphs (GIDs), implemented as an open-source library in Rust.
The data structure identifies live and dead states in an abstract transition system.
More precisely: given as input a list of graph updates like
```
AddEdge(1, 2)
AddEdge(2, 3)
Close(2)
AddEdge(3, 4)
Close(4)
Terminal(2)
```
the problem is to produce as output a list of *live* and *dead* states (vertices) in the transition system.
The meaning of this terminology is as follows:
- In the input, some states are labeled as "closed" meaning they are considered fully explored: no further outgoing edges will be added.
- In the input, some state are labeled as "terminal", meaning they are accepting states.
- In the output, a "live" state is one for which there is a path to a terminal state.
- In the output, a "dead" state is one for which all reachable states are closed and not terminal. In other words, a dead state is one that is known to not be live no matter what future edges are added to the transition system.

In this example, by the above definitions, `1` and `2` should be live and `4` should be dead.

The repository implements five competing solutions to the above problem:
- our amortized logarithmic-time per update algorithm (Algorithm 2, `log`)
- an even faster lazy algorithm (Algorithm 3, `jump`), and
- three baseline approaches for comparison: `bfgt` (the state of the art), `naive`, and `simple`.

## List of claims supported

The artifact supports the experimental results section of the paper (Section 4), summarized in Figures 4 and 5. In particular, the artifact supports the following claims:

- Algorithm 3 (`jump`) shows significant improvements over the state-of-the-art, solving more benchmarks in a smaller amount of time across basic GIDs, random GIDs, and regex GIDs.
- Algorithm 2 (`log`) also shows state-of-the-art performance, similar to BFGT on basic and regex GIDs and significantly better on random GIDs.
- In particular, Algorithm 3 exhibits up to two orders of magnitude speedup over BFGT for larger GIDs â€“ we measured speedups of 110x to 530x for GIDs in the top five size buckets (GIDs of size nearest to 100K, 200K, 500K, 1M, and 2M).
- Both algorithms, and our implementations of all the baseline approaches, exhibit correct output on all unit tests and benchmarks.

As a warning, the plots included in Figure 5 were generated using a Google spreadsheet, and cannot be produced automatically from the artifact. However, we include all information needed to reproduce these results, if necessary.

## Quick-Start Guide (smoke-test phase)

The artifact is provided as a docker container.
(TODO)

All commands are run through `cargo`, which is the Rust build system.
We recommend two small tests to see that everything is working correctly.

### 1. Run the unit tests

Once you have navigated to the `gid` directory, execute the following command:
```
cargo test
```

This should execute all the unit tests and should take under a minute. The output should include the following two important lines:
```
test result: ok. 36 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.01s
...
test result: ok. 56 passed; 0 failed; 8 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 24.44s
```

You will notice that there are 8 tests which are "ignored"; this is because they take an excessively long time to run.
(If you like, you can run these with `cargo test --release -- --ignored`, which should take about 10-15 minutes to complete.)

### 2. Run one of the examples

You can also run the artifact directly on one of the examples
using the provided `run_compare` and `run_example` binaries.
To run the example `examples/handwritten/15`:
```
cargo run --release --bin run_compare -- examples/handwritten/15
```

This should produce the following output:
```
===== examples/handwritten/15 =====
Example size: 8, timeout: 10s
naive: time 0ms
simple: time 0ms
bfgt: time 0ms
log: time 0ms
jump: time 0ms
```

You can also run a specific algorithm with the binary `run_example` instead of `run_compare`, and adding `-a n`, `-a s`, `-a b`, `-a l`, or `-a j`. For example, to run the `log` algorithm:
```
cargo run --release --bin run_example -- examples/handwritten/15 -a l
```

Which should produce the following output:
```
===== examples/handwritten/15 =====
Running algorithm 'log' with timeout 10s...
=== Output ===
ExampleOutput { live: [0, 1], dead: [4], unknown: [2], open: [3] }
=== Result ===
Stastics: time 0ms
Output is correct.
```

The input and output syntax for this example can be viewed in
`examples/handwritten/15_in.json` and `examples/handwritten/15_expect.json`, respectively.
The output `_expect.json` is used for testing correctness.
The syntax used is reproduced below:

Input:
```
[
    {"Add": [2,3]},
    {"Close": 2},
    {"Live": 1},
    {"Add": [0,1]},
    {"Add": [1,2]},
    {"Close": 1},
    {"Add": [3,4]},
    {"Close": 4}
]
```

Output:
```
{
    "live": [0, 1],
    "dead": [4],
    "unknown": [2],
    "open": [3]
}
```
