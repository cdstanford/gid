# Incremental Dead State Detection in Logarithmic Time

A guided incremental digraph (GID) is a data structure for solving incremental live and dead state detection in an abstract transition system.
Our algorithms, implemented in this repository, include an amortized logarithmic-time per update solution, a lazy algorithm, and several baselines.

Our paper will appear at CAV 2023:
